Download activation data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LhINDDAmJZrvKMafVMSEjkbGgEQgFl93?usp=drive_link) or compute it yourself in the `generate_activations` notebook. Expect it to take a while to generate.

## Notebook descriptions
- `generate_activations.ipynb`  Generates and saves the activations for each sentence in the STS dataset passed through `gpt2-medium`
- `train_weighted_cosine.ipynb` Trains a model that boils down to weighting the pairwise cosine distance at each layer
- Encoder stuff
- Siamese network big boy -- coming soon
- Autoencoder experiments -- coming soon
