Baseline with cosine similarity on gpt2-small is ~15-18% correlation.

Goal: 30%? I think that's pretty reasonable. As long as we're consistently beating cosine sim I think it's fine.

Tasks we're actually looking at working on:
- Sentence similarity (HARD)
- Language classification (Maybe easier?)
- Sentiment classification (Maybe easier?)
-
